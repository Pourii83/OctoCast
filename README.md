# OctoCast

Quartz-style cast bars for **OctoWoW** (1.12.1 client, Interface 11200).

## Features

- **Player cast bar**: replaces the Blizzard bar. Shows the spell icon, name and timer, colors casts and channels differently, and flashes green on success and red on failure.
- **Latency**: a red area at the end of the bar shows your real lag. It is measured from the key press to the server's cast start, and falls back to `GetNetStats` when that isn't available.
- **Pushback**: shows the delay added by damage taken (`+0.5`) on casts and channels.
- **GCD bar**: a thin bar with a spark under the cast bar.
- **Swing timer**: a main-hand melee timer that adjusts when haste changes.
- **Target cast bar**: needs [SuperWoW](https://github.com/balakethelock/SuperWoW) (`UNIT_CASTEVENT`). Without it, this bar stays inactive.

## Install

Clone or extract this repository into `Interface\AddOns\OctoCast`, so that `OctoCast.toc` sits directly in that folder.

## Commands

`/octocast` or `/ocast`

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `unlock` / `lock` | Move the bars with the mouse |
| `test` | Show a test cast on the player bar |
| `latency` | Toggle the latency display |
| `texture <name>` | Choose the bar texture and show a test cast: `smooth`, `gloss`, `minimal`, `banto`, `blizzard`, `flat` |
| `<bar> on` / `<bar> off` | Enable or disable a bar: `player`, `gcd`, `swing`, `target` |
| `<bar> width <n>` / `<bar> height <n>` | Resize a bar |
| `<bar> icon` | Toggle the spell icon |
| `reset` | Reset all settings and reload the UI |

## Limitations

- Without SuperWoW, the swing timer reads the combat log, so off-hand hits also reset it. "On next swing" abilities such as Heroic Strike don't reset it.
- The 1.12 client has no API for other units' casts, so the target bar only works with SuperWoW.
